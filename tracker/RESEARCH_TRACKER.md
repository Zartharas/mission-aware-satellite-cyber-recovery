## Final candidate novelty statement

This study introduces a reproducible software-in-the-loop experimental method for comparing satellite cyber-containment and trusted-recovery policies across mission states, telemetry-evidence conditions, and intermittent ground contact, while measuring adversary containment, mission continuity, safety-invariant preservation, and time to verified trusted recovery.

## Gate 3 status

WP4 has passed the host-runtime, schema, NOS3 source, recursive-submodule, cFE/OSAL/PSP, and container-digest controls. The project is now at the deterministic build gate. Event injection remains blocked until the network-disabled build succeeds, the bounded nominal command/telemetry baseline passes twice, and ground-truth logging is demonstrably separated from policy-visible evidence.
